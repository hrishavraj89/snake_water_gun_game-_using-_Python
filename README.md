# 🐍 Snake, Water, Gun – Python CLI Game

## 🎮 Description

A simple Python command-line game that implements the classic **Snake, Water, Gun** game. It's a fun and beginner-friendly mini-project to understand how to use:
- Dictionaries
- Random module
- Conditional logic
- User input handling

This version uses:
- `1` for **Snake**
- `-1` for **Water**
- `0` for **Gun**

## 🧱 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a value from `[-1, 0, 1]`.
- The user enters `'s'`, `'w'`, or `'g'`.
- The game maps both inputs to integers, compares them, and prints the result.
